'''
Implement a function called sort_students that takes a list of student objects as input and sorts the
list based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) in descending order. Each student object
has the following attributes: name (string), roll_number (string), and cgpa (float). Test the function
with different input lists of students.

    self.name = name
    self.roll_number = roll_number
    self.cgpa = cgpa

  # Sort the list of students in descrning order CGPA

                           reverse=True)
  #Syndax - lambda arg:exp
  return sorted_studends


# Example usage:
